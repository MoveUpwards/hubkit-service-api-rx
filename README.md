# Hubkit

Check https://app.hubkit.cloud

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MoveUpwards/HubKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Hubkit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage

```swift
import Foundation
import HubKit

final class HubKitService {
    var account: HKAccount?

    init() {
        // Set your config and api key
        Hubkit.default
            .set(project: "YOUR-PROJECT-IDENTIFIER")
            .set(config: Config(baseURL: plateform.baseUrl))
            .set(apiKey: HKApiKeyToken(apiKey: "PROJECT-API-KEY"))

        // Check the current user
        Hubkit.me(success: { [weak self] account in
            self?.account = account
        }, failure: { error in
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        })
    }
}
```
